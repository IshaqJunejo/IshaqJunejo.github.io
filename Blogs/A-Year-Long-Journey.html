        <h1 class="title">A Year Long Journey</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>This year has been pretty interesting for me in terms of the time spent trying to do and find some new things or skills or hobbies. <br>
            I tried a lot of new things this year and have planned for trying out more next year hopefully,</p>

            <h2>Initial Quarter of the Year</h2>

            <h3>7th of January - 1st of March</h3>

            <p>I consider the start of this journey by 7th of January,
            because on this day I tried Pixel Dailies for the first time and just decided to stick with it for as long as I could.
            This was going fairly great as I could see my consistency in form of my tweets.</p>

            <p>But the mindset of "Sticking With It For as Long as Possible" changed when I saw a tweet of a fellow pixel artist showcasing all his January's pixel dailies attempts,
            I wanted to do that too but I was missing the initial 6 attempts of the Month.
            Then I decided to make sure to stick with it for the Month of Feburary.
            I did sticked with it until the end of Feburary but found it difficult to stick for longer.</p>

            <p>On 1st of March I made a simple barrel for Pixel Dailies as the theme was BARREL,
            and after that my consistency in Pixel Dailies just disappeared into the thin air.</p>

            <p>I also have a Blog on <a href="https://mijgames.github.io/Blogs/Pixel-Art-for-54-days.html" class="showcase">Making Pixel Art for 54 Days Straight</a>.</p>

            <h3>4th of Feburary - 7th of Feburary</h3>

            <p>While keeping up with Pixel Dailies I also tried a Game Jam "Mini Jam 99 : Birds".
            It was a 3 days long Game Development jam.
            It's theme was announced before it started but limitation was announced just as the Jam started and limitation was "Can't Stop Moving".
            So I made a Topdown game with a Seagull as the player, who have to dogde poles on the surface of sea while keep on moving forward.</p>

            <h2>The Second Quarter of the Year</h2>

            <h3>15th of May - 26th of June</h3>

            <p>In this period of time I thought to try to learn DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms),
            so first of all I made a C file,
            copied code for making and reversing a Linked List and tried to see if it worked (for no reason, even though I knew it would work I still copy pasted some code).</p>

            <p>I tried doing DSA by myself for sometime, but felt it pretty boring, so on 3rd of June I created an account on Leetcode.
            Initially I tried choosing some random problems on Leetcode and try to solve them, but just 2 days later I joined "2 Weeks Study Plan To Tackle DS".
            In the beginning I was trying to solve any problem that I can and leave the one which I didn't understood,
            but changed my mind later and started looking on the internet for solutions of problems which I didn't understood and try to understand their solutions.
            And it worked fairly well, I was starting to understand more about Data Structures and how they can be used.</p>

            <h2>The Third Quarter</h2>

            <h3>2nd of June - 13th of September</h3>

            <p>During the start of June I had started journaling my days before going to bed.
            I just wrote about the things I did which were productive and which were unproductive.
            I was fairly consistent with it and felt some positive changes in my productivity too.</p>

            <p>I did for more than 3 months (104 days to be precise) straight.
            I eventually stopped journaling my days because of sudden change in my schedule due to admission in Higher Secondary School.</p>

            <h3>21st of July</h3>

            <p>I published my first Game made with C#, Round Pong.
            This game was made solely because I wanted to learn C#,
            I saw few YouTube Videos on how I can learn C# and tried to setup Raylib_cs on my system which is basically a wrapper for Raylib.</p>

            <p>I also recorded a timelapse of the process and upload it on YouTube. Which was just my second YouTube video.
            I also open-sourced it just as it was released,
            which reminded me about how I can work on some open-source projects or open-source my previous projects I made for practice.</p>

            <h3>1st of August - 30th of August</h3>

            <p>I was working on my open-source project "Radius2D".
            I had made this project earlier in C++ but didn't open-sourced it.
            As I was looking for some project to work on GitHub and it's code was complete spaghetti,
            I decided to make it from scratch using C# while having it on a GitHub repository.
            I decided to name the repository "Radius2D" and upload the old files of C++ code and worked on C# to replicate it.
            After that I realized it's performance was bad and needed to be improved.</p>

            <p>I have written a Blog on my experience of <a class="showcase" href="https://mijgames.github.io/Blogs/Working-on-physics-engine.html">Working on my own Physics Engine</a>.</p>

            <h3>19th of August - 21st to August</h3>

            <p>While working on Radius2D I gave myself a break of two days because,
            I joined the Kenney's Jam 2022. Theme of the Jam was "Growth".
            For the Jam I made a game with Space Battle,
            where you have to fight Enemy Battle Ships and collect their Material to grow Size of your Battle Ship.
            I recorded the Time-lapse and uploaded on YouTube, and also open-sourced it on GitHub.</p>

            <h3>3rd of September - 20th of September</h3>

            <p>It was the time when I decided to build my own Personal Portfolio Website.
            I made it with the purpose of showcasing all my projects at one place,
            including the Game uploaded on Itch open-source projects on GitHub and even some pieces of my Pixel Art.
            I also had a thought that I might even write some Blog Posts.</p>

            <p>I made the website added different sections to it,
            and though Blogs were not available in the beginning, I added them soon after it was deployed.
            For Pixel Art, it was not added for a fairly long time.</p>

            <h2>Last Quarter</h2>

            <h3>24th of September - 25th of December</h3>

            <p>I have gotten admission in a Higher Secondary School,
            and am having little to no time for working on my projects.
            I decided to work on my projects only on Weekends.
            On those weekends I worked on Radius2D as well as my Website,
            I wrote the Blogs in that time, added some new features in Radius2D in that time,
            published Radius2D's Nuget Package and even added Pixel Art Section on my Website.</p>

            <p>I have a Blog about <a href="https://mijgames.github.io/Blogs/My-experience-with-programming-on-weekends-only.html" class="showcase">Programming on Weekends only</a>.</p>

            <h2>Goals for 2023</h2>

            <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                <li>
                    <h3>Contribute to Open-Source Projects</h3>
                    <p>I would want myself to contribute to some open-source projects by other individuals on GitHub to experience how it is like to work with others.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Write 12 Blogs</h3>
                    <p>I also want myself to write blogs for my own Website.
                    I have set a target of 12 Blogs Next Year (1 Blog Each month),
                    which might sound like a small target, but I don't want myself to focus on numbers,
                    but I want to push myself to do something new every month and write it in format of a Blog.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Work on an A.I or M.L Based Project</h3>
                    <p>I am currently very interested in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning,
                    but I couldn't work on a project regarding that topic due to lack of my knowledge.
                    So I set a target to learn more about them and work on an A.I or M.L project or more specifically a Neural Network project with Genetic Algorithm.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Get Back to Journaling My Days</h3>
                    <p>I feel like journaling my days had a positive effect on me and leaving them was a bad idea.
                    So I would try to journal my days for as long as possible,
                    so that I can develop a habit out of it.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p class="date">20-March-2024</p>
            <p>
                It has been almost two months now, that I have been working on a new small project,
                and most of the work is done in my free time only.
                This project is centered around visualizing Maths,
                to be fair, only a few Mathematical Concepts so far.
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea for working on this project came from a simple realization
                that equations can look something close to gibberish.
                But once I get to witness them on a graph, they suddenly start
                to mean something beyond what I had previously understood.
                I can see the essence behind these equations.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am aware that there already exists a bunch of free and paid software
                that can graph almost any equation that you can come up with.
                I also find myself using Desmos quite frequently. This is why I don't
                have any revolutionary expectations or intentions from this project,
                I would be glad even if my classmates get help from this project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Visualizing the equation is not the only part of the process of working on this project,
                <em>Interactiveness</em> is also an essential part of this project.
                It is so that when using it, we can see how the equation behaves with the changing inputs.
            </p>
            <h3>Some Sortta Title</h3>
            <p>
                The first visualization that was implemented in this project was
                of the <em>Pythagorean Theorem</em> by visualizing the area of 
                <em>Base^2</em>, <em>Perp^2</em>, and <em>Hyp^2</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then visualization of <em>Linear Equation</em> was implemented.
                Then, visualizations for the <em>Exponential Equation</em>, <em>Logarithmic Equation</em>,
                and <em>Solution of 2 Linear Equations</em> were implemented, and so far,
                a few more visualizations have been implemented.
            </p>

            <h3>Another Random Title</h3>
            <p>
                I still haven't made the project public because of a few things
                that I am not sure whether I want to change or not, for example,
                the design of the Home Page, and the design of an explanation with canvas on mobile.
                But one other reason is that I don't have a creative Name for the project,
                so far I have only been using “Math Visualizer” as a placeholder text in HTML and Figma.
            </p>
            <p>
                I will try to get these things in order and will make this project public as soon as I can.

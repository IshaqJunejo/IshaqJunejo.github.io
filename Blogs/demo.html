            <p>Doing something consistently for more than a month long can take a huge motivation and a solid reason to do so.
             I also have tried doing it with pixel art.</p>
            <p>The story behind this lies back when I finished a game jam submission,
             and while trying others submissions I was also checking their creator profile on itch,
             and while visiting someone's profile I saw his Twitter which had mostly tweets of pixel art having a common Twitter handle being tagged in.
             and that is how I came to know about Pixel_Dailies.</p>
            <p>Pixel Dailies is basically a Twitter handle which uploads a theme everyday to challenge pixel artists to attempt to scope small and make small pixel art pieces which could be completed in one day and make them everyday.
             This can make them practice consistency.</p>
             <p>I noted about that thing down and decided to attempt it too after few days,
             those few days became few weeks but I did came back to Pixel Dailies Twitter account and after checking out it's theme I decided to procrastinate one more day and attempt later.
             Fortunately I did that, on that day ( 7th of January 2022 ) the theme was #tent, I looked for some reference images and tried having an isometric approach,
             it didn't turned out to be as good as expected, but first time none game pixel art being that was good enough to look like that.</p>

            <p>As it was scaled up by using Microsoft Paint -- as I didn't knew gimp could also be used to scale it without blurring it
             -- so it left white empty spaces in the top and left of the canvas,
             I didn't noticed them before posting it on Twitter. So I left it like that and didn't bothered to do anything except for avoiding it from next time.</p>

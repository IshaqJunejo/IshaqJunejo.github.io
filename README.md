# Personal-Portfolio

This is my Personal Portfolio website, which I made with the purpose of sharing my work online.
This website has a section of Projects, Pixel Art and of Blogs.
Projects section contains all my projects that I have worked on, Pixel Art section has listed all the small pieces of Pixel Art that I made, and I also write Blogs sometimes, which I treat more like Journaling and less like Content Creation.

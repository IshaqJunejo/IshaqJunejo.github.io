                        It has been a little less than two months since I started working on a new project.
                        The idea for this project was quite straightforward,
                        it was supposed to be an app that displays a few Flashcards...

                        and most of the work is done in my free time only.

                        As the year 2023 is coming to an end, it is time to reflect on what the previous
                        twelve months have been like and reflect on my goals for this year.
                        This year has made me realize that some chapters of our journey don't unfold...

                        Two months ago, I was working on a simple Neural Network project with the standard MNIST Dataset,
                        Because I made that Neural Network mostly by copying someone else's code and trying to understand it,
                        I thought trying a few different things with it would be...

                        I recently tried to make a pretty simple and small Neural Network
                        to understand how Neural Networks work, specifically how

                        especially on its design. So I decided to try if I can improve it or not
                        So, I opened up Figma, copied the design of my website,
                        and started looking for where I can improve the desi...

                        I tried a lot of new things this year and

                        Developing your own physics engine can be seriously hard,
                        as it involves a lot of calculations, vectors usage and obviously lots of physics formulas too.
                        Still I decided to give it a try because I wanted to do some experime...

                        Doing something consistently for more than a month long can take a huge motivation and a solid reason to do so.
